<p class="has-text-align-center">This website will help assist you in learning to cook. Our website has recipes that are purposely vague in the amount of ingredients to use. This is so you can <strong>learn</strong> to <strong>cook </strong>rather then learn to read a recipe. These recipes should give you enough information to make a good meal every time, but there's no better way to learn then trial and error. If you season something too much the first time, you'll know how much to put on next time. And if you burn something you can make sure to cook at a cooler temperature next time.</p>
